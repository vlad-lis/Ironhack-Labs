#1. In the table actor, what last names are not repeated? 
#For example if you would sort the data in the table actor by last_name, 
#you would see that there is Christian Arkoyd, Kirsten Arkoyd, and Debbie Arkoyd. 
#These three actors have the same last name. So we do not want to include this last name in our output. 
#Last name "Astaire" is present only one time with actor "Angelina Astaire", hence we would want this in our output list.
